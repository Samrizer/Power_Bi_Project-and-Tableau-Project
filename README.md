# Examining Sales and Shipping Information:

## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps to analyze shipping and sales performance across different countries and product categories. There is a need to understand trends in the total number of boxes shipped, sales revenue fluctuations over time, and product-wise contributions to overall sales. Additionally, tracking increases and decreases in revenue across different time periods is crucial for decision-making. The key challenge is identifying patterns, optimizing logistics, and improving product distribution strategies to enhance overall efficiency and profitability.

### Steps followed 
## Sum of Boxes Shipped by Country:

The overall quantity of boxes sent to several countries is the main emphasis of this picture.

Important Takeaways:

1. The graph compares shipping volumes in countries including the USA, UK, India, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
2. Countries with larger bars (e.g., the United States) imply higher shipping volumes, whereas shorter bars (e.g., New Zealand) indicate lower quantities.
3. This assists in determining which regions are critical to the company’s success.

## Application Scenario:
This research helps enhance logistics and distribution tactics by concentrating on high-demand areas.

## Sum of Boxes Shipped by Product:
The total number of boxes transported by-product is broken out in this graph.

## Important Takeaways:

1. Top performers in terms of shipping volume include Dark Bites (9.8K boxes) and Smooth Silky S... (8.8K boxes).
2. Other goods, such as Drinking Coco and Milk Bars, have average delivery volumes.
3. This helps you determine which products are in strong demand and which may require further marketing or distribution efforts.
## Application Scenario:
Companies may utilize this information to enhance inventory control and rank top-performing items.

## Sum of Amount by Year, Quarter, and Month:
This picture depicts the total amount (presumably income or sales) over time, split down by year, quarter, and month.

## Important Takeaways:

1. The graph depicts monthly trends for 2022, with values ranging up to 0.9 million.
2. Certain months (such as January 2022) indicate larger quantities, while others (such as February 2022) show decreases.
3. This aids in recognizing seasonal trends or times of high and poor performance.
## Application Scenario:
This technique is important for evaluating revenue trends and forecasting seasonal changes.

## Sum of Amount by Year, Quarter, Month, and Product:
This graph shows a more thorough breakdown of the total amount over time and between items.

## Important Takeaways:

1. Some items, such as Milk Bars and 85% Dark Bars, deliver consistent results.
2. However, there are notable declines in some months (e.g., February 2022), with negative values such as -0.14M.
3. Underperforming goods (e.g., 99% Dark & Pure) and external market variables might be contributing to the reduction.
##  Application Scenario:
This enables organizations to identify poor goods or periods and implement remedial steps.

##  Highlights of the Project:
### Regional Perspectives:
The Sum of Boxes Shipped by Country visualization identifies major markets, allowing organizations to focus on high-demand locations.
### The performance of the product:
The Sum of Boxes Shipped by Product graph highlights top-performing goods for improved inventories and marketing tactics.
### Trends Based on Time:
Visualizing the Sum of Amount by Year, Quarter, and Month helps anticipate and plan income based on seasonal trends.
### In-depth Evaluation:
The Sum of Amount by Year, Quarter, Month, and Product graph offers a detailed perspective of performance, enabling firms to manage decreases and optimize product offerings.
##  Instruments and Methods Employed:
Power BI: It is used to visualize data and create interactive dashboards.

Data cleansing: Prior to analysis, data consistency and correctness were guaranteed.

The ability to drag and drop: facilitated the creation of visualizations without requiring a lot of code.

## Conclusion:
This Power BI project has been a fantastic learning opportunity, allowing me to extract significant insights from sales and shipping data. I was able to spot patterns, optimize plans, and address areas for improvement by displaying data at many levels, including geography, product, and time.

## Acknowledgements:
I’d like to express my deepest gratitude to EduLinking Career and Prof. Dr. Karim Mohammed Rezaul for their informative webinar on Power BI. Their advice and skills were invaluable in helping me learn the subtleties of data visualization and properly use Power BI for my project. The webinar not only improved my technical abilities, but also encouraged me to go deeper into the area of data analytics.


# Tableau_Project

## Using Tableau to Visualize Sales Data: 

### Beginning to Use Tableau:
I found it simple to get started with Tableau because to its intuitive UI. I started by importing my sales data, which included monthly sales statistics and the corresponding subcategories for areas like technology, office supplies, and furniture. I didn’t need to know a lot of code to quickly construct visualizations thanks to the drag-and-drop capabilities.

## Dashboard 1: Profit Map
This is a screen grab of my initial dashboard, which is centered around a profit map. It aids in my comprehension of profit distribution by classifying data into segments such as Wypeing, Upchart, and Arbana.

## Dashboard 2: Sales by Category
This dashboard explores sales in further detail by category and subcategory. Items like Art Binders, Envelopes, and Machines are included, giving a clear picture of the things that are generating the most revenue.

## Dashboard 3: Monthly Sales
This graph displays the monthly sales trends for three product categories: technology, office supplies, and furniture. Every category has its own chart, with sales patterns from 2018 to 2021 shown by the various coloured lines. The y-axis displays sales figures, while the x-axis depicts the months of January through December.

Sales of furniture rise gradually throughout the year until reaching a high at the end. The tendency for office supplies is more evenly distributed, with sporadic upswings. Sales of technology are the most erratic, fluctuating sharply throughout the year. This graphic aids in comparing how sales trends fluctuate between years and categories.

## Knowledge Acquired
One of the most important things I learned from my dashboards was how consistently technology products — especially phones and accessories — performed. In order to increase income, it is crucial to concentrate on high-performing categories. The monthly sales data also showed seasonal patterns, with some months having larger sales volumes than others.

## Learning and Difficulties
While Tableau is user-friendly, I had certain difficulties, particularly when working with huge datasets. Maintaining data correctness and consistency was critical. I also learnt the value of selecting the appropriate style of visualization to effectively express the data’s story.

## Acknowledgement
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to EduLinking Career and Prof. Dr. Karim Mohammed Rezaul for their informative webinar on Tableau. Their advice and skills were invaluable in helping me comprehend the subtleties of data visualization and efficiently use Tableau for my projects.

## Conclusion
I’ve had such a fulfilling experience using Tableau. In addition to improving my data visualization abilities, it has given me insightful information that may influence business choices. To fully realize the potential of their data, I urge everyone interested in data analysis to investigate Tableau.
